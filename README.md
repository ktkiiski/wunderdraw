WunderDraw
==========

This is a solution to [Wunderpahkina vol. 5](https://github.com/wunderdogsw/wunderpahkina-vol5) programming challenge, made by Kimmo Kiiski.

It is written in JavaScript and can be run in any modern browser that supports **ECMAScript 6**.

- [`wunderdraw.js`](./wunderdraw.js) is the JavaScript solution
- [`index.html`](./index.html) is the webpage containing the base elements and the script
- [`wundernut.png`](./wundernut.png) is the original puzzle image to solve
